# Probes

A probe is any substance which can be physically present in a container. Each type of probe captures slightly different meta data which is specific to that category.


## Types

The following probe types are currently present in Glybrary:

1. Linkers
2. Glycoconjugates
3. [Proteins](/user/guides/probes/Proteins.md)
4. [Antibodies](/user/guides/probes/Antibodies.md)
5. Chemicals

*Note*- More probe types will be added as we develop further


## Unique Probe Identifier

Each probe is provided a unique probe identifier which is an identifier that is unique among all probes. The unique probe identifier makes it easy to find probes and track them.

A good probe identifier is something absolutely unique and can include some information about the source, catalog number and batch or date of preparation. 

It can have a maximum of 50 characters.
