# Probes

A probe is any substance which can be physically present in a container. Each type of probe captures slightly different meta data which is specific to that category.

The following probe types are currently present in Glybrary:

1. Linkers
2. Glycoconjugates
3. Proteins
4. Antibodies
5. Chemicals

*Note*- More probe types will be added as we develop further
