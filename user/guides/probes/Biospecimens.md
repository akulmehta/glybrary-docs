# Biospecimens

Biospecimens to be assayed or printed should be entered under the biospecimen probes.

## Add New Biospecimen

**Before you begin to add a new biospecimen, make sure to enter any detecting antibody or protein into Glybrary first.**

To add a new biospecimn:
1. Click on **"Probes"** in the navigation bar at the top of the screen and click on **"Biospecimen"**
1. Click on the **"New Biospecimen"** button at the top. If you do not see the button, 
you have a [user role](/user/guides/UserRoles.md) incapable of adding this entry and may need to contact the administrator to grant you an access.
1. A data entry form should load which can help you enter information.
    - Mandatory fields in this form are usually marked in red and/or have an asterisk in their label.
    - If you do not have information for a non-mandatory field please leave it blank. 
    - **The more information that is entered, the better it is to design the experiments around this, so please try to fill in as much information as possible.**
    - Note - Do not add any personally identifiable information (PII) for human subjects. Please see the list of PII to avoid. If you have any questions about PII,
    please contact the admins.

    Information to be added:
    1. Enter a [Unique Probe Identifier](/user/guides/Probes.md#unique-probe-identifier) which can help identify this entry. Note:
        - A good probe identifier is something absolutely unique and can include some information about the source, catalog number and batch or date of preparation.
        - The unique probe identifier cannot be changed once it is set. So make absolutely sure what you enter here.
    1. Add any alternate names. Type the alternate name and enter a semicolon to separate multiple names.
    1. Find and Select the biospecimen species.
    1. Select the biospecimen type. If the biospecimen type does not exist in the list, choose "Other" biospecimen type and enter information about a new type and 
    the classification for it. If the classification for it does not meet one of the predefined selections, you can choose "Other" and add a new classification as well.
    1. Enter the collection year (i.e. the year in which the biospecimen was collected) and select the tissues which the biospecimen is from.
    1. Add subject information such as age (number and units), race, sex, country, diseases, phenotypes, any treatment the subject received.
    1. Add sample treatment information (e.g. the sample was treated with EDTA).
    1. Select the Biospecimen Source and enter relevant information.
    1. Add any external database entries by clicking the blue `+` button . e.g. RRIDs. 

    1. Enter the specification information such as the purity, method of purity determination, safety precautions, incompatibilities, cofactors, suitable buffers and known ligands.
    1. Enter the Storage and Handling information such as recommended conditions and known stability.
    1. In the Containers/Tubes section add information about the containers/tubes which will be made available. 
        
        More information about [Containers](/user/guides/probes/Containers.md).
    1. Select the preferred detection method.
        
        More information about [Preferred Detection Method](/user/guides/probes/PreferredDetectionMethod.md).
    1. If the biospecimen was chemically labeled (e.g. Alexa Fluor 488), then use the "Chemical Label" section to describe the chemical modification.
    1. Add any additional information by creating additional fields
    1. Attach any files e.g. data sheets and certificates of analysis. This may need to be done after creating the biospecimen entry by editing it.
    1. Add any publications e.g. publications describing the expression of the biospecimen.
    1. Select the visibility for either 
        1. "Private": only members of the lab and you can view this entry.
        2. "Public": everyone can view this entry.
