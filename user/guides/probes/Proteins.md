# Proteins

Proteins to be assayed or printed should be entered under the protein probes.

## Add New Protein

**Before you begin to add a new protein, make sure to enter any detecting antibody or protein into Glybrary first.**

To add a new protein:
1. Click on **"Probes"** in the navigation bar at the top of the screen and click on **"Proteins"**
1. Click on the **"New Protein"** button at the top. If you do not see the button, 
you have a [user role](/user/guides/UserRoles.md) incapable of adding this entry and may need to contact the administrator to grant you an access.
1. A data entry form should load which can help you enter information.
    - Mandatory fields in this form are usually marked in red and/or have an asterisk in their label.
    - If you do not have information for a non-mandatory field please leave it blank. 
    - **The more information that is entered, the better it is to design the experiments around this, so please try to fill in as much information as possible.**

    Information to be added:
    1. Enter a [Unique Probe Identifier](/user/guides/Probes.md#unique-probe-identifier) which can help identify this entry. Note:
        - A good probe identifier is something absolutely unique and can include some information about the source, catalog number and batch or date of preparation.
        - The unique probe identifier cannot be changed once it is set. So make absolutely sure what you enter here.
    1. If assigned a request id/number, then select the request number/identifier from the list available to you.
    1. Enter the protein name, description, sequence (if known), genetic sequence (if known).
    1. Add any external database entries by clicking the blue `+` button . e.g. UniProt IDs. 
      
          *Note if you add a UniProt ID, you can retrieve information about the protein such as name, sequence and species from Uniprot by clicking the .*
    1. Find and Select the protein species, i.e. the species of the sequence.
    1. If the protein is glycosylated and the glycans are entered in Glybrary, you can find and link glycans.
    1. Add any alternate names. Type the alternate name and enter a semicolon to separate multiple names.
    1. Enter the specification information such as the purity, method of purity determination, safety precautions, incompatibilities, cofactors, suitable buffers and known ligands.
    1. Enter the Storage and Handling information such as recommended conditions and known stability.
    1. In the Containers/Tubes section add information about the containers/tubes which will be made available. 
        
        More information about [Containers](/user/guides/probes/Containers.md).
    1. Select the preferred detection method.
        
        More information about [Preferred Detection Method](/user/guides/probes/PreferredDetectionMethod.md).
    1. Select the Protein Probe Source and enter relevant information.
    1. Select the Production Method and enter relevant information.
    1. If the protein was modified (e.g. His tag), then use the "Add Modifications" section to describe the modification.
    1. If the protein was chemically labeled (e.g. Biotin), then use the "Chemical Label" section to describe the chemical modification.
    1. Add any additional information by creating additional fields
    1. Attach any files e.g. data sheets and certificates of analysis. This may need to be done after creating the protein entry by editing it.
    1. Add any publications e.g. publications describing the expression of the protein.
    1. Select the visibility for either 
        1. "Private": only members of the lab and you can view this entry.
        2. "Public": everyone can view this entry.
