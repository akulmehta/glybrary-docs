# Preferred Detection Method

You can select the preferred detection method for a probe entered into Glybrary.

## Adding Preferred Detection Method

Before you begin, if the probe you are entering needs to be detected by either protein or antibody, make sure to add it separately in Glybrary. 
Please let the administrators know if you need to do this so that they can enable access for you to make this entry.

1. In the data entry form locate the "Preferred Detection Method" Section.
2. Select Type of Detection 
    1. Labeled with fluorescent tag or protein - select this if the probe is itself fluorescently labeled with a tag e.g. Cy5 labelled antibody.
    2. Protein detection - select this if a protein (present in Glybrary) can be used to detect the probe. Example, Streptavidin-Cy5.

        Note - If the protein you are looking for does not exist, you can click the "Add Detection Protein" to add a new protein, if you have permissions to do so.
    3. Antibody detection - select this if an antibody (present in Glybrary) can be used to detect the probe. Example, Goat Anti-Human IgG Alexa 488.

        Note - If the antibody you are looking for does not exist, you can click the "Add Detection Antibody" to add a new antibody, if you have permissions to do so.
    4. Unknown - If you are unsure of what to add as the detection method select this and enter some suggestions in the "Detection Notes" section
3. Add any "Detection Notes" about conditions known for the detection of the probe based on other studies.
