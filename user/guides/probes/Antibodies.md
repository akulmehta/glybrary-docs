# Antibodies

Antibodies to be assayed or printed should be entered under the antibody category of probes.

## Add New Antibody

**Before you begin to add a new antibody, make sure to enter any detecting antibody or protein into Glybrary first.**

To add a new antibody:
1. Click on **"Probes"** in the navigation bar at the top of the screen and click on **"Antibodies"**
1. Click on the **"New Antibody"** button at the top. If you do not see the button, 
you have a [user role](/user/guides/UserRoles.md) incapable of adding this entry and may need to contact the administrator to grant you an access.
1. A data entry form should load which can help you enter information.
    - Mandatory fields in this form are usually marked in red and/or have an asterisk in their label.
    - If you do not have information for a non-mandatory field please leave it blank. 
    - **The more information that is entered, the better it is to design the experiments around this, so please try to fill in as much information as possible.**

    Information to be added:
    1. Enter a [Unique Probe Identifier](/user/guides/Probes.md#unique-probe-identifier) which can help identify this entry. Note:
        - A good probe identifier is something absolutely unique and can include some information about the source, catalog number and batch or date of preparation.
        - The unique probe identifier cannot be changed once it is set. So make absolutely sure what you enter here.
    1. Enter general information, such as the antibody name, description, amino acid sequence (if known), genetic sequence (if known), clone number, 
        preparation type (whole antibody, ascites etc), clonality (monoclonal, polyclonal), isotype (IgG, IgM, IgA), subtype (1, 2, etc.),
        the immunogen against which the antibody was created, the epitope (if known), the cross reactivity (if known), and any results from alternate testing.
    1. Add any alternate names. Type the alternate name and enter a semicolon to separate multiple names.
    1. Find and Select the host species, and the target species (if known). If the target species is unknown or non specific, please indicate so.
    1. Add the antibody production information. Please add as much detail as possible.
    1. Add information about how the antibody was purified in the "Antibody Purification" section.
    1. Add any external database entries by clicking the blue `+` button . e.g. RRID. 
    1. Add database entries for known targets (e.g. proteins) in the "Target External Database Entries" e.g. UniProt IDs of the target proteins.
    1. Enter the specification information such as the purity, method of purity determination, safety precautions, incompatibilities, cofactors, suitable buffers and known ligands.
    1. Enter the Storage and Handling information such as recommended conditions and known stability.
    1. In the Containers/Tubes section add information about the containers/tubes which will be made available. 
        
        More information about [Containers](/user/guides/probes/Containers.md).
    1. Select the preferred detection method.
        
        More information about [Preferred Detection Method](/user/guides/probes/PreferredDetectionMethod.md).
    1. Select the Antibody Source and enter relevant information.
    1. If the antibody is glycosylated and the glycans are entered in Glybrary, you can find and link glycans.

    1. If the antibody was modified (e.g. His tag), then use the "Add Modifications" section to describe the modification.
    5. If the antibody was chemically labeled (e.g. Cy5), then use the "Chemical Label" section to describe the chemical modification.
    6. Add any additional information by creating additional fields
    7. Attach any files e.g. data sheets and certificates of analysis. This may need to be done after creating the entry by editing it.
    8. Add any publications e.g. publications describing the expression of the protein.
    9. Select the visibility for either 
        1. "Private": only members of the lab and you can view this entry.
        2. "Public": everyone can view this entry.
